`Unitful.FreeUnits{(Unitful.Unit{:Meter,typeof(𝐋)}(0,1//1,1.0,1//1),),typeof(𝐋)`.
After dividing by `s`, a singleton of type

A quantity, which has dimensions and units specified in the type signature.

dimensionless, unitless number results.

The type parameter `T` represents the numeric backing type. The type parameters
